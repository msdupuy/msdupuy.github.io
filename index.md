# About me

I am a maître de conférences (associate professor) at the [Laboratoire Jacques-Louis LIONS](https://www.ljll.fr/) (16-26-304) in Sorbonne Université (Paris, France). I was previously a postdoctoral researcher in TU Munich (Germany) with [Gero Friesecke](https://www.math.cit.tum.de/math/personen/professuren/friesecke-gero/) on the grant SFB/TRR 109 [Discretization in Geometry and Dynamics](https://www.discretization.de/). I did my PhD in Université Paris-Diderot under the supervision of [Xavier Blanc](https://www.ljll.fr/~blanc/).

My research focuses on the analysis of models and numerical methods for molecular systems or materials.

I also have worked on tensor trains for high-dimensional problems. Lecture notes on this topic are available [here](teaching/TT_lectures_2025.pdf).

I am the co-organiser of the [GT NumerIQ](https://numeriq.pages.math.cnrs.fr/) which is a working group at the LJLL on quantum computing for scientific computing. I am also co-organising the [CEMRACS summer school](https://cemracs2025.math.cnrs.fr/en/) (15/07-22/08) on quantum computing.
